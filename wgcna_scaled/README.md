# WGCNA

Run WGCNA on 1000s of GSE id's and forget about it.

## What does this do?

Takes in a file containing GSE accessions from Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO), downloads it and runs WGCNA on them giving diagnostics on all the runs. Saves the modules for each GSE id and gives an option to add the modules to a GeneQuery module file.
